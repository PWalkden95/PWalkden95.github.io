FII estimates the proportion of functional trait space retained in ecological assemblages compared to that expected in the absence of modelled anthropogenic pressures. As such FII may fill a gap in the monitoring of biodiversity that aligns with the Kunming-Montral Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF)."
